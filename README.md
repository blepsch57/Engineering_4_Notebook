## Raspberry Pi Zero Intro

### Lessons Learned

Set up Raspberry Pi Zero, connected it to monitor, booted it, and wrote a simple bash script to print "Hello World" 10 times using a loop. We learned how to output text to the shell, run a script, and use a for loop in a bash script.

### Code

[helloWorld.sh](/Scripts/helloWorld.sh)

## Mathematica Intro

### Lessons Learned

Started Wolfram Mathematica on Raspi 0 to practice basic commands. We learned how to evaluate expressions, define and operate on lists, plot lists, derive and integrate functions, and create a dynamic plot of a function with constants controlled by user input through sliders. 

### Code

[firstproject.nb](/Mathematica/firstproject.nb)

## Python Intro

### Lessons Learned

Wrote a Python script (using IDLE) to print "Hello World" 10 times by looping. Then made a dice roller program that uses the built-in random library to generate a random integer between 1 and 6 inclusive repeatedly at the user's request, then end the program when prompted.

### Code

[helloWorld.py](/Python/helloWorld.py)

[automatic_dice.py](/Python/automatic_dice.py)

## Python - Calculator

### Lessons Learned

Wrote a Python script that when given two real numbers a and b outputs a+b, a-b, a\*b, a/b, a%b, and a^b. Learned how to iterate over dictionary keys and use lambda notation.

### Code

[calculator.py](/Python/calculator.py)

## Python - Quadratic Solver

### Lessons Learned

Wrote a Python script that when given the coefficients of a quadratic equation finds all real solutions. Learned how to use conditional expressions, and that it's not always the right choice to use conditional expressions.

### Code

[quadraticSolver.py](/Python/quadraticSolver.py)

## Git Intro

### Lessons Learned

Created git repository for our engineering notebook, made a github account, and linked our repo to one on github. Learned how to initialize a git repository, link it to a remote (hosted on Github), make commits, and push to the remote. 

## Git - Forks and Clones

### Lessons Learned

Forked a repository owned by the chssigma github account, cloned it to our computer, edited the users file in the appropriate directory, committed, pushed, and submitted a pull request to merge our edits back into the original repo. Learned how to fork and clone a git repository, as well as how to make and comment on a pull request.

## Git - Engineering Notebook

### Lessons Learned

Started the actual Engineering 4 notebook in our notebook repo by writing it in the README using Markdown. Learned how to use vim more effectively and how to format in Markdown.

## Python - Strings and Loops

### Lessons Learned

Wrote a Python program to split a string across a delimiting character (in this case " "), then print it out letter by letter.

### Code

[stringSplitter.py](/Python/stringSplitter.py)

## Python - Hangman

### Lessons Learned

Wrote a Python program to play hangman with the user after a word has been inputted. Learned how to execute terminal commands from within a python script.

### Code

[hangman.py](/Python/hangman.py)

## Bash - GPIO Pins

### Lessons Learned

Wrote a bash script that uses GPIO pins on the Pi to make an external LED blink (after soldering a male-male header to those pins). Learned how to use GPIO output from a Pi Zero.

### Code 

[ledBlink.sh](/Scripts/ledBlink.sh)

## Python - GPIO Pins

### Lessons Learned

Wrote a python script using the RPi.GPIO library to blink LEDs on a timer. Learned basic usage of said library.

### Code

[gpio_led_blinker.py](/Python/gpio_led_blinker.py)

## SSH - GPIO Pins

### Lessons Learned

Used SSH to remotely access the pi and turn an LED on and off using bash.

## Flask Intro

### Lessons Learned

### Code

[app.py](/Python/Flask/hello_world/app.py)

## Flask GPIO

### Lessons Learned

### Code

[index.html](/Python/Flask/gpio/index.html)

[app.py](/Python/Flask/gpio/app.py)

[app.pyc](/Python/Flask/gpio/app.pyc)

## GPIO I2C

### Lessons Learned

### Code

[gpio_i2c.py](/Python/gpio_i2c.py)

## Headless Accelerometry

### Lessons Learned

### Code

[headless.py](/Python/headless.py)

## Pi Camera

### Lessons Learned

[picamera1.py](/Python/picamera1.py)

[picamera2.py](/Python/picamera2.py)

[picamera3.py](/Python/picamera3.py)

## Pi Alarm

### Lessons Learned

### Code

[gpio_alarm.py](/Python/gpio_alarm.py)

## Copied Assignment (Parts 1 and 2)
