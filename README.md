## Raspberry Pi Zero Intro

### Lessons Learned

Set up Raspberry Pi Zero, connected it to monitor, booted it, and wrote a simple bash script to print "Hello World" 10 times using a loop. We learned how to output text to the shell, run a script, and use a for loop in a bash script.

## Mathematica Intro

### Lessons Learned

Started Wolfram Mathematica on Raspi 0 to practice basic commands. We learned how to evaluate expressions, define and operate on lists, plot lists, derive and integrate functions, and create a dynamic plot of a function with constants controlled by user input through sliders.

## Python Intro

### Lessons Learned

Wrote a Python script (using IDLE) to print "Hello World" 10 times by looping. Then made a dice roller program that uses the built-in random library to generate a random integer between 1 and 6 inclusive repeatedly at the user's request, then end the program when prompted.

## Python - Calculator

### Lessons Learned

Wrote a Python script that when given two real numbers a and b outputs a+b, a-b, a\*b, a/b, a%b, and a^b. Learned how to iterate over dictionary keys and use lambda notation.

## Python - Quadratic Solver

### Lessons Learned

Wrote a Python script that when given the coefficients of a quadratic equation finds all real solutions. Learned how to use conditional expressions, and that it's not always the right choice to use conditional expressions.

## Git Intro

### Lessons Learned

Created git repository for our engineering notebook, made a github account, and linked our repo to one on github. Learned how to initialize a git repository, link it to a remote (hosted on Github), make commits, and push to the remote. 

## Git - Forks and Clones

### Lessons Learned

Forked a repository owned by the chssigma github account, cloned it to our computer, edited the users file in the appropriate directory, committed, pushed, and submitted a pull request to merge our edits back into the original repo. Learned how to fork and clone a git repository, as well as how to make and comment on a pull request.

## Git - Engineering Notebook

### Lessons Learned

Started the actual Engineering 4 notebook in our notebook repo by writing it in the README using Markdown. Learned how to use vim more effectively and how to format in Markdown.
